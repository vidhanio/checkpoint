# Woodlands Checkpoint

## Basic Setup

1. Add [Woodlands Checkpoint](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=896067278393712651&permissions=402653184&scope=bot%20applications.commands) to your server (requires manage roles and manage nicknames permissions)
2. Create to role be given to verified members (e.g. `@Verified`)
3. Create a channel for non-verified members to verify themselves in (e.g. `#verification`)
4. Set up permissons for the role so that only the verified members can see the normal channels
5. Set up the verification channel so only non-verified members can see it (verified members cannot see it)
6. Use `/config set verified` with the roles you made earlier (e.g. `/config set verified role:@Verified`)
7. Woodlands Checkpoint should be set up! ðŸ˜„

### Fixes to Try

- In both channel settings and role settings, make sure you are allowed to use application commands
- Make sure that the `@Woodlands Checkpoint` role is higher than your verified role
- The bot will not nickname you if your highest role is higher than the `@Woodlands Checkpoint` role

## Advanced Setup

### Grades

1. Create grade roles for the grades your server will choose to support (e.g. `@Grade 9`)
2. For each grade role, use `/config add grade` with the grade and role (e.g. `/config add grade grade:9 role:@Grade 9`)
3. When members use `/verify`, they will now receive their grade role! ðŸ˜„

### Pronouns

1. Create pronoun roles for the pronouns your server will choose to support (e.g. `@He/Him`)
2. For each pronoun role, use `/config add pronoun` with the role (e.g. `/config add pronoun role:@He/Him`)
3. Members can now use `/set pronouns` to set their pronouns! ðŸ˜„

## Self-Hosting

1. Make copies of `students.example.json`, `guilds.example.json`, and `example.env`
2. Remove the `.example` from each of the filenames
3. Fill `students.json` with student information*
4. Put your Discord bot token in the `.env`
